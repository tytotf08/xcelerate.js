# xCelerate JS

a Javascript framework which lets you create a webpage - with only a few lines of JScript code. You create an index.html page with just the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset = "UTF-8"/>
</head>
<body>
  <script src = "xcelerate.js/xcelerate.js"></script>
  <script src = "main.js"></script>
</body>
```
and of course, some custom HTML if you'd like.
main.js is the only user system requirement, and you'll need this repo in that folder. 
If you go to main.js and type `print("Hello world!");` and load the HTML page in a browser, the page will display "Hello World!". You can view the xCelerate JS source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tytotf08/xcelerate.js/master/xcelerate.js)

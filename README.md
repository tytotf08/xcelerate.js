# xCelerate JS

a Javascript framework which lets you create a webpage - with only a few lines of JScript code. You create an index.html page with just the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src = "dominat.us/xcelerate.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
```
and of course, some custom HTML if you'd like.
You should also create two files: main.js and style.css. xCelerate JS looks for these files when the page starts. They can be empty, but are system requirements for xCelerate.

# xCelerate JS

a Javascript framework which lets you create a webpage - with only a few lines of JScript code. You create an index.html page with just the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset = "UTF-8"/>
</head>
<body>
  <script src = "https://tytotf08.github.io/xcelerate.js"></script>
  <script src = "main.js"></script>
</body>
```
and of course, some custom HTML if you'd like.
main.js is the only user system requirement.

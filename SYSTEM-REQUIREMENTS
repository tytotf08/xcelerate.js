--- System Requirements For xCelerate JS---

main.js - your xCelerate Client where you code your xCelerate.js
style.css - external stylesheet

PLEASE NOTE:
You can also CDN to xcelerate-min.js where there aren't any system requirements, but this is not as maintained and functional as xCelerate.js main javascript page.
